<p>In the first part you are required to respond to a set of statements on a scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. For example:</p>
<p>I like Chocolate. </p>
<p>Here you will click in a drop down box "strongly agree" if you strongly agree with the statement I like chocolate. Some other questions will be answered True or False in a drop down box.</p>
<p>Some questions will ask for your opinion on ethical clothing which is clothing that seeks to minimise its negative impact on the environment, employees and animals via processes that include, but are not limited to, slow fashion. Slow fashion is an approach to making clothes to ensure they are worn as many times as possible to reduce waste, this is achieved through more durable fabrics and designs that last more than one fashion season.</p>
