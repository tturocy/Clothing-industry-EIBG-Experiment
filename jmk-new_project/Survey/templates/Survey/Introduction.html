        Welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an experiment in the economics of decision-making.
        If you follow the instructions, complete the experiment
        and make appropriate decisions, you can earn an appreciable amount of money.
        This will be paid to you at the end of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your decisions in this experiment will be recorded anonymously, and there will
        be no way to identify you in the collected data.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are three (3) parts to today's experiment.
        You will receive instructions for each part of the experiment at the start
        of that part.
