<p>
    In this task you will have to count the number of zeroes in the table 5 times.
    For each table you guess correctly you will earn 10p so you can earn a maximum of Â£0.50.
    You will have 30 seconds to guess the right answer for each table, however,
    if you run out of time you will not earn 10p and will be moved to the
    next page where a new table will be.
    You will not lose money for guessing wrong or running out of time.
</p>

<p>
    After the 5th table you will see your answers and the correct ones so you can work out your earnings.
