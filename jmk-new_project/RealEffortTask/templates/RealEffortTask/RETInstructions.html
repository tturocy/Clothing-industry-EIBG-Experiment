<p>
    In this part, you will see 5 tables consisting of zeroes and ones.
    For each table, your task is to count the number of <strong>zeroes</strong>
    appearing in the table.
    For each table for which you provide the correct count, you will earn
    <strong>£0.10</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    You have up to <strong>30 seconds</strong> to count the number of zeroes
    in each table.  If you run out of time, or count incorrectly, you will earn
    <strong>£0.00</strong> for that table.
</p>

<p>
    At the end of this part, you will see a summary page listing your answers,
    the correct counts, and your earnings for this part of the experiment.
