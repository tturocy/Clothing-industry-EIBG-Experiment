<p>To recap, your earnings from today's experiment are:
    <ul>
    <li><b>{{part1_earnings}}</b> for completing Part 1;</li>
    <li><b>{{part2_earnings}}</b> for counting the number of zeroes in tables in Part 2;</li>
    <li>A one-in-ten chance of receiving a <strong>Â£25 gift card</strong> from
        <strong>{{player.get_GiftCard2_display}}</strong>
        which you selected in Part 3.</li>
</ul>
</p>
