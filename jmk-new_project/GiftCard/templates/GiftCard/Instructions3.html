<p>In Part 3 you will enter a lottery for a gift card
    worth £25 where you have around a 10% chance to win.
    Your task is to choose which gift card you would like.
    First, you will be presented with 5 clothes retailers named A, B, C, D and E
    and their ethical rankings for environmental responsibility, employee welfare,
    animal welfare and slow fashion. You must click on the letter of the retailer
    you would like in the drop down box to get a £25 gift voucher for that retailer
    you were to win. Then you will be asked to choose again with the same retailers
    but their brand names will now be revealed, this choice will decide which brands'
    gift card you actually select and may possibly win.</p>

<p>The rankings for the retailers are based on on evidence from
    industry reports, company websites, industry initiatives and public scandals.
    All of the clothes retailers sell both men and women’s clothes with a price
    range mainly from £0 to £100.
