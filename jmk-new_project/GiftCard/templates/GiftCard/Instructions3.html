<p>
    In Part 3, you have the opportunity to receive a gift card worth £25
    from one of five major apparel retailers.
    The retailers sell both men's and women's clothes, at prices mainly
    under £100.
</p>

<p>
    You will select the retailer you prefer in two steps.  In the first
    step, you will not know the name of the retailers, but you will receive
    information on how the retailers rank on the categories of
    <strong>environmental responsibility</strong>,
    <strong>employee welfare</strong>,
    <strong>animal welfare</strong>,
    and <strong>slow fashion</strong>.
    The rankings for the retailers are based on evidence from
    industry reports, company websites, industry initiatives and
    scandals reported in the media.
</p>

<p>
    After making your initial choice, the names of the five retailers
    will be revealed.  You will then have the option of retaining your
    original choice of retailer, or switching to one of the other
    retailers.
</p>

<p>
    After the experiment is completed, you will be entered into a
    drawing with all the other participants in this experiment.
    We will draw one out of every ten participants at random
    to receive a gift card to the retailer chosen in the second
    step (the one in which the retailer names are known).
    We will send an email to all participants after the completion
    of the experiment listing the winning participant numbers.
    You are <strong>Participant {{ participant.id_in_session }}</strong> in the experiment.
