        &quot;Slow fashion&quot;
        is an approach to making clothes to ensure they are worn
        as many times as possible to reduce waste.
        This is achieved through more durable fabrics and designs that last
        more than one fashion season.

    <dt class="col-2">Retailer A (5/5)</dt>
    <dd class="col-10">
        They’re a living wage employer and their production methods are of a higher ethical standard than the industry initiatives for employees, animals and the environment. Also, their clothes design and durability mean they are the best example of slow fashion.
    </dd>
    <dt class="col-2">Retailer B (2/5)</dt>
    <dd class="col-10">
        Environmentally they rank 3/5 as they are signed up to 4/5 of the industry environmental initiatives however only 36% of their materials are recycled or sustainable. For employee welfare they rank 2/5 because they participate in 3/4 of the industry labour initiatives, but pay a living wage to less than 1% of their supply chain and they have been involved in 2 labour scandals with few charitable projects relative to their size. Animal welfare ranks 4/5 because they banned fur and non-mulesed sheep earlier than retailers C, D and E. However, they still sell leather and some other animal products. They are a fast fashion retailer so rank 2/5 for slow fashion.
    </dd>
    <dt class="col-2">Retailer C (3/5)</dt>
    <dd class="col-10">
        Environmentally they rank 2/5 because they’re a part of 2/5 of the environmental industry initiatives and don’t report how much of their products are made from recycled or sustainable materials. For employee welfare they rank 3/5 because they’re in 3/4 of the labour initiatives however they have a bad labour scandal involving factory conditions. Animal welfare ranks 3/5 as they’ve banned exotic furs and non-mulesed sheep but sell leather. The design and durability of their clothes are second to that of retailer A so rank 4/5 for slow fashion.
    </dd>
    <dt class="col-2">Retailer D (4/5)</dt>
    <dd class="col-10">
        Environmentally they rank 4/5 because they’re in nearly all environmental initiatives and over half of their products are made from recycled or sustainable materials. Employee welfare ranks 4/5 due to their participation in 3/4 labour initiatives and charitable projects. Their animal welfare ranks 2/5 as they were late to ban exotic furs. Their slow fashion ranks 3/5 as they sell durable clothes but change their styles often but less than retailers B and E.
    </dd>
    <dt class="col-2">Retailer E (1/5)</dt>
    <dd class="col-10">
        They’re involved in very few industry initiatives for the environment, employees and animals. They have been proven to still sell exotic furs and use less than 1% of recycled or sustainable materials in their clothes. Also, their clothes are not well made and styles are changed a lot.
